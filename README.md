## 0. Preliminary

Due to the copyright issue, the SMPL model file cannot be provided. You need to access [https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) to access the SMPL model [download page](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/downloads). Then, dowload the model package: version 1.0.0 for Python 2.7 (10 shape PCs) and extract the file. You need to use **extract_SMPL_model.py** (use Python 3 to run the code) in **0.preliminary** to generate SMPL model used in the training of mmMesh. For example, if you extract the file in the same folder with **extract_SMPL_model.py**, you can use:
```bash
python extract_SMPL_model.py ./SMPL_python_v.1.0.0/smpl/models/
```
to generate two files: **smpl_f.pkl** and **smpl_m.pkl**.
**Note**: you need to install [Chumpy](https://github.com/mattloper/chumpy) to run the code.

## 1. Real-time mmWave Data Capturing

To enable real-time data capturing, the first step is to start the radar in **Windows**. The softwave used in the paper is `mmWave Studio 2.0.0.2`. Just load **DataCaptureDemo\_1843new.lua** and click the **Run!** button on the left bottom corner of the softwave as show in the image.

Then the radar will keep sending the chirps and steaming the data through networking cables.

Then, change the operating system of the computer to **Ubuntu**, or unplug the cable on the **Windows** machine (you used to start the radar) and connect the cable to a **Ubuntu** machine. (**Note**: all the Python files are executed on a **Ubuntu** machine during our experiments.)

In **Ubuntu**, you will use **steaming.py**. The methods in the class will automatically collect the packets from the radar and assemble them into frames. It also allows you to access these frames using `getFrame` method. As an example, if you want to capture the data from the mmWave radar for 5 mins and store them, just run:
``` bash
python capture.py 5
```

## 2. Point Cloud Generation from Binary mmWave Data

The methods in **pc_generation** allows you to generate the point cloud from the binary mmWave radar.For example, if you want to generate the point cloud data from `test.bin` for 10 frames, try:
``` bash
python pc_generation.py test.bin 10
```

**Note**: to successfully read the data from the binary file, you should change the radar configuration to generate the binary file without the packet head.

## 3. mmMesh Deep Model

Model training:
``` bash
python train_model.py
```

Model inference:
``` bash
python infer_model.py
```

**Note**: to run the code, you need to move the **smpl_f.pkl** and **smpl_m.pkl** generated in step 0.Preliminary to the current folder.
